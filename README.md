# Estimating-Heston-MLE-MOM

This repository contains the 2022 Summer Semester Project of WUTIS, which consists in the replication of the study conducted in the paper "Estimating Option Prices with Heston's Stochastic Volatility Model" by Robin Dunn, Paloma Hauser, Tom Seibold, Hugh Gong (hereafter referred as "the paper")  and an extension to an analysis on options from the S&P500 using a more recent time-period (01 Januray 2005 to 01 December 2021) which is also covering Covid years. This is done to prove additional robusteness of the estimating models MOM and ML

In the repository you will find: 
- the original paper.
- the notebook with the code and the results from the replication and the estention from the paper.
- the csv with data for the options coming from the paper.
- power point slides from our pitch.
